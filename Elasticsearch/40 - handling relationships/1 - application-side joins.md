# 应用端联接(Application-side Joins)

We can (partly) emulate a relational database by implementing joins in our application. For instance, let’s say we are indexing users and their blog posts. In the relational world, we would do something like this:

```json
PUT /my_index/user/1 
{
  "name":     "John Smith",
  "email":    "john@smith.com",
  "dob":      "1970/10/24"
}

PUT /my_index/blogpost/2 
{
  "title":    "Relationships",
  "body":     "It's complicated...",
  "user":     1 
}
```

The index, type, and id of each document together function as a primary key.

Finding blog posts by user with ID 1 is easy:

```json
GET /my_index/blogpost/_search
{
  "query": {
    "filtered": {
      "filter": {
        "term": { "user": 1 }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

To find blogposts by a user called John, we would need to run two queries: the first would look up all users called John in order to find their IDs, and the second would pass those IDs in a query similar to the preceding one:

```json
GET /my_index/user/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "name": "John"
    }
  }
}

GET /my_index/blogpost/_search
{
  "query": {
    "filtered": {
      "filter": {
        "terms": { "user": [1] }  
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The values in the terms filter would be populated with the results from the first query.

The main advantage of application-side joins is that the data is normalized. Changing the user’s name has to happen in only one place: the user document. The disadvantage is that you have to run extra queries in order to join documents at search time.

In this example, there was only one user who matched our first query, but in the real world we could easily have millions of users named John. Including all of their IDs in the second query would make for a very large query, and one that has to do millions of term lookups.

This approach is suitable when the first entity (the user in this example) has a small number of documents and, preferably, they seldom change. This would allow the application to cache the results and avoid running the first query often.
